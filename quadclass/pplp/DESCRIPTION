PPLP

Two independent quadruplexes in the asymmetric unit (A and B) that are stacked on each other in a head-to-head manner.
Two single-residue linkers form two propeller (double-chain reversal) loops that bridge three G-quartet layers.
Third loop, connects two G-quartet corners and the stem-loop allows the terminal to be inserted back to the G-quartet core.
