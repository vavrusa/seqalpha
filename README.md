# Quadruplex family classification

Tools for recognition of the G-quadruplex structures in the PDB models and a
classification into GQ families based on the topology. As a complement, the library also
supports a prediction of a GQ family from known GQ-forming sequences using a novel predictor.

The software is divided into the library and commandline tools, and the web interface.

## Library and tools

This can be found in the `quadclass` subdirectory.

## Web interface

A web interface written in Python and Flask for convenient integration with the existing
sequence analysis workflow. It can be found in the `web` subdirectory.
