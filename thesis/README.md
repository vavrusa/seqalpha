# Computational analysis of sequence families in DNA quadruplexes

The thesis presents an automated approach on the G-quadruplex structure classification with respect
to the structure topology, and a novel method for heuristic prediction of a G-quadruplex topology
from the nucleotide sequence. As a result, tools for both classification and prediction are developed and evaluated.
